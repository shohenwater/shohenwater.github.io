  </header>
  <div>
<p>I am an Actuarial Science graduate from Northern Illinois University. In my regression and time series analysis classes I learned that I had talent and enjoyed working with data. Post-graduation I worked to gain Python and SQL skills to acquire a broad skill set to collect, clean, investigate, and create easily understandable visuals. </p>
<p>While doing this, I worked as a substitute teacher where I was able to improve upon my ability to communicate ideas to novice audiences and earned a long-term substitute position. In this position I was able to work both individually and as part of a team to problem solve through the COVID-19 situation and help my special needs students. </p>
<p>I have always been a curious person and have appreciated the unexpected insights that working with data allows. My personal goal is to always expand my abilities and learn new ideas. Ideally, I would love to be employed somewhere where the work I do will improve the lives of many people and I can work on big problems that need big ideas to solve.</p>
<p>I love to talk data whenever I can. Feel free to email me at shohenwater@gmail.com to talk about any of my analyses or data in general!</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting
